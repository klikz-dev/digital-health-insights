        1. How do I receive a pass code or user ID?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        Send an e-mail to mostwired@chimecentral.org with your organization’s
        name, city and state, Country. Many hospitals have the same name; please
        do not forget to include city and state.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        2. Can I save the survey and finish it later?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        Yes. The survey will automatically save your progress.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        3. Is there a way to get a copy of the full survey so I can determine if
        we want to participate or to research the questions before inputting the
        answers online?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        A PDF of the complete survey will be made available in early April 2021.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        4. Some questions require a screenshot. Where should I send the
        screenshot?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        Screenshots should be e-mailed to mostwired@chimecentral.org.

        5. I am filling out the survey for more than one hospital. How do I
        answer?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        If you are filling out the survey for more than one hospital, your
        answers must reflect the AVERAGE OF ALL HOSPITALS represented.
        <br />
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <br /> For what percentage of pharmaceutical supplies is an electronic
        order generated when they reach a predetermined par level with
        appropriate internal controls?
        <br />
        None
        <br />
        1-20%
        <br /> 21-40%
        <br /> 41-60%
        <br /> 61-80%
        <br /> 81-100%
        <br /> If you are answering the survey for 10 hospitals and 3 of the 10
        hospitals order 100% of supplies electronically and the other seven
        order 0% electronically, you should check the 21-40% box since 30% is
        the weighted average across the entire system.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        6. Can we put the entire hospital campus (3 hospitals) on one survey? Or
        would you prefer if we filled out a survey for each hospital?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        That is a decision for the organization to make. You are able to submit
        the survey both ways. It may depend on how you would like to be
        represented, if you prefer to have the health system represented as a
        whole or if you’d like each individual hospital to receive separate
        feedback.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        7. Are all questions scored?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        No. Questions under the categories of “Organizational Information” and
        “General Information” are used for identification and benchmarking
        purposes only which will not affect Most Wired status. Additionally,
        there are questions marked within the survey as “Not Scored”.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        8. Should outsourcing or application service provider models be
        included?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>Yes.</p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        9. Should depreciation and IT expenses in other departments be included
        in IT operating expense?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        Yes, these expenses are important to include for total operating costs.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        10. What should be included in IT capital?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        We usually include the costs for acquisition, licensing and
        implementation for infrastructure (hardware, storage, network, data
        center) and software, as allowed by what can be capitalized per GAAP. As
        an example, we would include the cost of the PACS application, hardware,
        etc. But we would not include the digital acquisition devices that we
        added or swapped out over time. IT capital expense includes IT related
        capital included in the budget of other departments (e.g., lab,
        radiology, etc.), if known or can be reasonably estimated. Include the
        total value of capital leases to be signed in the current year.

        11. Our organization is planning to have this technology in place later
        this year. Can I go ahead and answer the question as if we already had
        it in place?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>All technology should be in place by 3/31/2021.</p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        12. When will I know if my organization is recognized?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        We will send e-mail notifications by late-August to all participants to
        let them know if they received a Most Wired designation or not, your
        organizations benchmark report will be included at that time as well. If
        you do not receive your benchmark report, please email
        mostwired@chimecentral.org.
      </p>

      <h3 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>
        13. I submitted my survey, but we answered a question incorrectly. Can I
        correct this?
      </h3>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        Yes. Corrections to survey submissions are allowed up to 90 days after
        results have been released to participating organizations.
